This is known as Total Variation (TV) regularisation and tends to enforce piecewise constant areas separated by sharp edges. Recall that for example Tikhonov regularisation may reduce noise but tends to blur edges, so TV may have an advantage if the image to be reconstructed is known to consist of relatively homogeneous areas separated by sharp edges. In CIL, TV is available as the `TotalVariation` function and from the CCPi regularisation toolkit as `FGP_TV` which can be run on the `GPU`.
