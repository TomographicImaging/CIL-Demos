    "This exercise introduces Tikhonov regularisation and explains how this is implemented in the CIL framework using the so-called block framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous exercise, it was seen how CGLS could be used to determine a reconstruction based on the least squares reconstruction problem. It was seen that in case of noisy data, the least squares solution obtained by running until convergence is not desirable due to a high amount of noise. The number of iterations was seen to have a regularising effect, with the smooth, low-frequency components of the image recovered in the first iterations, while high-frequency components of the image such as edges were recovered later. Unfortunately, noise also kicks in, and one needs to pick the number of iterations that best balances the sharpness and amount of noise. As such, the regularising effect is implicitly obtained by choosing the number of iterations to run and never actually running until converged to the least squares solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tikhonov regularisation is more explicit in that a regularisation term is added to the least squares fitting term, specifically a squared 2-norm. This problem should now be solved to convergence instead of using the number of iterations as implicit regularising effect. Instead, a parameter, the regularisation parameter, balances the emphasis on fitting the data and enforcing the regularity and must be chosen to provide the best trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tikhonov regularisation tends to offer reduction of noise in the reconstruction, at the price of some blurring. This will be seen in what follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up Tikhonov problems we need to represent block matrices and concatenate data. In CIL we can do this using BlockOperator and BlockDataContainer as demonstrated in the exercise."
