    "The most common analytic reconstruction algorithm is filtered back-projection (FBP). The FBP algorithm is derived from the Fourier Slice theorem which relates line integral measurements to the two dimensional Fourier transform of an object’s slice. Although the Fourier Slice theorem provides a straightforward solution for tomographic reconstruction, its practical implementation is challenging due to the required interpolation from Polar to Cartesian coordinates in the Fourier space. In FBP-type reconstruction methods, projections are ﬁltered independently and then back-projected onto the plane of the tomographic slice. Filtration is used to compensate for non-uniform sampling of the Fourier space (higher frequencies have higher density of sampling points) by linear (Ramp) weighting of the frequency space."
