    "Conventional X-ray detectors only measure the variable density of objects they pass through, giving no insight into what materials are actually inside. This is because standard detectors measure only the number of photons that arrive at each point on the detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "For hyperspectral imaging, one can use an energy-sensitive X-ray detector, which measures the energy of every X-ray photon that arrives at each individual pixel. This provides an additional layer of information which can provide important insight on a sample's composition or structure. However, adapted reconstruction routines are required to account for the extra energy-based dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "The additional energy dimension is stored as a histogram of energy 'channels', indicating the number of X-ray photons detected by a pixel within a fine energy range. Typically 200+ channels are acquired, however in order to speed up computation time, we will restrict our dataset to just 40 channels, where the dominant energy signals are known to appear.   \n",

    "We can very clearly see the impact of the spectral regularisation using PDHG TV, with all noise entirely removed, and an almost perfectly smooth transition across energy channels. We still clearly see the rising edge at the iodine K-edge position. The use of spectral correlation enforces our operator to use the previous energy channel as a reference point for reconstructing data in the next, resulting in a smoother transition across channels."

That is, we can select only the energy channels occupied by the absorption edge, so all reconstructed signal is now due only to the iodine contrast agent. This method is known as **'K-edge subtraction'**, which you can read about in more detail in papers such as that by [C.K.Egan *et al*, 2015](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep15979#).  \n",

    "We have covered three key algorithms (FDK, CGLS and PDHG) and shown the various ways in which we can build them, both with and without the addition of regularisation terms. We have also explored how each type of regularisation impacts our resulting reconstruction, highlighting why optimisation of our regularisation parameters is so important to produce the highest quality data. This is further highlighted through the extraction of both spatial and spectral profiles, as well as extraction of elemental maps using spectral analyses like K-edge subtraction.
