By tilting the sample and rotating it around a vector perpendicular to the sample plane the path-lengths stay relatively constant. However, this geometry leads to some artefacts in the reconstruction from the missing data. These artefacts are particularly prevelant when you look at a slice out of the sample plane.\n",
