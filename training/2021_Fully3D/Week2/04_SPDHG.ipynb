    "<h1><center> Stochastic Primal Dual Hybrid Gradient Algorithm: Tomography </center></h1>\n",
    "\n",
    " In this demo, we learn how to use the Stochastic Primal-Dual Hybrid (SPDHG) algorithm introduced in [Chambolle et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04957), see as well [Ehrhardt et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07150), [Papoutsellis et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06126), [Gutierrez et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01255). This algorithm is a stochastic version of the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) Algorithm by [Chambolle & Pock](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00490826/document). We focus on Tomography Reconstruction under an edge-preserving prior, i.e., the __Total variation regularisation__, see [ROF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_variation_denoising). \n",
    "\n",
    " ## Why SPDHG?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous demo, we presented __PDHG__ for tomography reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__SPDHG__ is a stochastic version of __PDHG__. As PDHG, SPDHG can solve convex, non necessarily smooth optimization problems and is provenly convergent. \n",
    "\n",
    "The central improvement with respect to PDHG is that SPDHG can deal with __subsets of data__, making it computationally more efficient, so that it can deal with **larger datasets**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For CT and PET for example, the data can be divided into a collection of partial sinograms, each of them corresponding to a subset of the total set of angles. Accordingly, the projection operator $A: X \\rightarrow Y$ can be decomposed as $A=(A_1, \\dots, A_n): X \\rightarrow Y=Y_1\\times \\dots \\times Y_n$ where $n$ is the number of subsets and each $A_i:X \\rightarrow Y_i$ is a __partial__ projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration, SPDHG computes only one partial forward and back-projection $A_i,\\,A_i^*$ for a randomly chosen index $i$, whereas PDHG computes $A$ and $A^*$. Hence SPDHG requires only a fraction of the computations of PDHG per iteration, which makes it faster per iteration.\n",
